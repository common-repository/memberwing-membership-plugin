   './wp-content/plugins/membership-site-memberwing/*'
   OR
   './wp-content/plugins/memberwing-membership-website-premium-p1/*'

2. Activate plugin at the plugin administration page.

3. If you see an error: "Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error" - try to activate is second time.
   Second try might be required to activate IonCube and it is normal with some hosting providers.

   NOTE: MemberWing software uses IonCube technology to protect integrity of it's source code.
   IonCube technology is supported by most quality webhosts.
   MemberWing tries to detect and reactivate IonCube support automatically for you.
   If you still see errors trying to activate plugin do this:

      http://www.YOUR-WEBSITE-NAME.com/wp-content/plugins/MEMBERWING-DIRECTORY/ioncube/ioncube-loader-helper.php
   -  If you still having problems trying to activate IonCube - that means your hosting provider did not
      enable IonCube support.
      Please contact your hosting provider and request this: "Please activate IonCube for my account".
      Most respectable hosting providers will be happy to either accomodate your request quickly and provide you
      with clear instructions on how to do so.
      If your hosting provider will refuse to accomodate your request (for whatever reason they present)
      we recommend you to change hosting provider to the one that offers reliable services and support for
      modern technologies.

   Digital Content Theft Prevention - TraceFusion
   ----------------------------------------------
   TraceFusion is a digital fingerprinting of every piece of digital contents that leaves your site. Digital "fingerprint" or digital signature is a unique peice of information that is secretly
   embedded inside of digital materials that are being downloaded or accessed at your site. TraceFusion digital signature contains information about your site, as well as about the person who downloaded your materials.
   This way if you found some of your materials illegally shared and distributed on internet - you will be able to pinpoint with digital precision who was the person that downloaded it and when it took place.
   TraceFusion digital fingerprint is encrypted and no one can access it's content but yourself.
   TraceFusion is enabled by default and requires very little configuration. You may turn it off via Wordpress/MemberWing admin panel if wanted to.
   MemberWing allows to digitally sign binary (images, movies, downloads, ebooks, sound files) as well as text content such as articles, pages and posts.
   The following information is embedded into each digital signature:
   - Your website address - where content belongs to.
   - Date and time the content was downloaded from or accessed at your site. Precision: 1 second
   - IP address of person who accessed it
   - Precise version of software he used to access it, such as web browser or software script.
   - Member's username as assigned by MemberWing/Wordpress.
   - Authenticated name, if your system uses additional authentication measures (additional to Wordpress login info).
   - Member's first and last name (if set in his User account settings)
   - Member's email.
   - Address of page he came from and was refered from.
   Using above data you will be able to uncover content thiefs and take appropriate measures to prevent further learks.

   To read digital signatures that are mebedded into binary files or text pages - please go to
   http://www.tracefusion.com/trace/ and follow instructions.

   Please note - only you may read digital signatures that were embedded by MemberWing with your license key.
   You cannot read digital signatures generated by other webmasters and they cannot read yours.
   Digital singatures are impossible to modify or tamper with without completely damaging them. It is impossible to modify them as they are being encrypted and checksummed with multiple layers of algorithms.
   While they may be removed from text/html pages manually - it will be difficult to do the same with binary downloadable materials without risk of damage to them.


   Digital Content Protection with PromoFusion logic
   -------------------------------------------------
   Digital Content Protection (DCP) prevents content theft by denying unauthorized users attempt to download premium files
   directly by discovering and typing URL to files in their browsers.
   DCP forces user to be logged on to view premium pictures, movies, download ebooks and other materials.
   The way it is being handled by other software (if handled at all) is visitor is either redirected to "denied" page or
   served with plain 404 error in case of unauthorized attempt to premium digital content.
   But MemberWing IV includes powerful enhancement to DCP named PromoFusion designed specifically for promoting and marketing premium content to visitors as potential prospects.
   Instead of plainly denying access to content and throwing new visitor or prospect away -
   premium media will be automatically substituted with the promotional version of material in the same format.
   At a discretion of a webmaster PromoFusion will automatically and transparently serve shorter version of movie or 'promotional' edition of movie.
   Full version of Ebook (www.yoursite.com/premium/ebook.pdf) could be automatically substituted with the shorter version of Ebook
   where last page will explain benefits of buying full version and show "buy now" link.
   Similar concept is ready to be implemented with images as well as with any other protected contents.
   URL will remain the same but content will differ depending on type of user who is accessing it.

   DCP with PromoFusion delivers triple benefits:
      1. Instead of losing valuable prospect - PromoFusion logic will keep him occupied with the lighter version of site content
         and maintain delivery of promotional and marketing message to engage him to become a premium member.
         This is a concept of promotional 'teasers' ported into digital content protection and delivery logic.
      2. Google will be able to find, index and rank premium materials at their original URLs.
         This way your prospects searching for information on search engines will be able to arrive on your site,
         pre-view your content and get interested to join your membership site.
         There is no reason to deny, forbid or prevent if you can promote and engage.
      3. Zero-configuration zero-effort automation. DCP with PromoFusion It is always on.
         As soon as webmaster uploads substitution content - it will immeditately be ready to be served instead of premium materials.

   Automatic substitution of premium content could be done on 3 levels:
      - For example, for this premium file
         /home/public_html/PREMIUM_FILES/photos/myimage.jpg

      - PromoFusion will make an attempt to serve these files in these order for free users:
         1. File level:       /home/public_html/PREMIUM_FILES/photos/myimage_denied.jpg
            This will make substitution file-specific.

         2. Directory level:  /home/public_html/PREMIUM_FILES/photos/denied.jpg
            All premium *.jpg files in the same directory will be substituted to 'denied.jpg' for free visitors,
            unless file level substitution was found.

         3. Site Level:       /home/public_html/PREMIUM_FILES/denied.jpg
            All premium *.jpg files in will be substituted to 'denied.jpg' for free visitors,
            if neither file- not directory level substitution was found.

         4. Denied            404 error will be served to visitor
            No substitution was found anywhere. Last resort.


   To configure DCP with PromoFusion:
   -  Login to your Wordpress admin panel
   -  Go to Settings->Permalinks
      -  Under "Common Settings" - make sure anything *but* "Default" is selected.
      -  Suggested setting - best for SEO: (*) Custom Structure: /%postname%/
   -  Login to MemberWing admin panel at Settings->MemberWing plugin
   -  Set/confirm physical location of premium files to be protected by DCP in "Location of premium files, use FTP..." box.
   -  Set/confirm WEB URL for premium files in "WEB URL to link to above..." box.
   -  IMPORTANT: make sure WEB URL settings does not point directly to the physical location of "premium files".
      For example:
         Incorrect setting:
         ------------------
         Location of premium files: /home/userjoe/public_html/premium/secret_pic.jpg
         WEB URL                            http://mysite.com/premium/secret_pic.jpg  <- directly points to above location - INCORRECT

         Correct setting:
         ------------------
         Location of premium files: /home/userjoe/public_html/PREMIUM_FILES/secret_pic.jpg
         WEB URL                                  http://mysite.com/premium/secret_pic.jpg

   -  Use your FTP program to upload your premium files into above physical location.
      These files could be anything - images, movies, flash files, etc...
      You may create subdirectories to arrange hierarchy of your premium files as you see fit
   -  Create new post/page, embed premium content inside of it via URL derived from "WEB URL for premium files".
      This way it comes under guard of DCP.
      Always use WEB URL (configured at Admin panel->Settings) to link to premium files.
   -  Create PromoFusion substitution file and set it's name by appending '_denied' to original file's name. Example:
      Original file: ---------------------------------------- SEMINAR.swf
      PromoFusion substitution file name, file level: ------- SEMINAR_denied.swf  (place it in the same directory)
      PromoFusion substitution file name, directory level: -- denied.swf          (place it in the same directory)
      PromoFusion substitution file name, site level: ------- denied.swf          (place it in the root directory for all premium files: ./PREMIUM_FILES/)

   NOTES:
      -  Preparing and uploading of substitution files is optional but highly recommended step.
      -  Once substitution files are uploaded - they will be automatically delivered to free visitors according to rules described above.
      -  If some premium members are still seeing 'promotional' version of digital materials after logging in - pease advice them to clear cache of their browsers.
         Because premium digital file and "free version" (promotion) digital file are using the same URL - web browsers often try to cache this data aggressively to save bandwidth. Therefore clearing browser's cache will resolve this issue.


   Gradual Content Delivery (dripping content)
   -------------------------------------------
   Gradual Content Delivery functionality allows you to load your membership site with many articles but
   only gradually release them to your members if their membership is maintained in a good standing (active).
   This will prevent new members from leeching all your premium content (by signing up, copying everything and cancelling subscription).
   This will also help you, as a membership site owner to maintain your subscription base for longer.
   If your membership site is paid - above benefits means more money for your business.
   -  When creating an article scroll down toward "Custom Fields" section.
   -  Enter key: maturity
   -  Enter value as number, for example: 10
      This would mean that only users who been an active members for at least 10 days will be able to see this article.
      In other words 'maturity' specifies for how many days user needs to be a member to see this article.
      Administrator of course will be able to see everything.
   -  Save article.
   -  Spawn another browser and see that new article is not visible (because you are not logged on in another browser)

   NOTE: Gradual Content Delivery only works for articles/posts. It does not affect static pages.
